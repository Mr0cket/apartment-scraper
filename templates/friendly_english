Hi {AGENT_NAME},

I am interested in renting your apartment on {STREET}.

A little bit about myself: I am a 29-year-old software engineer who is responsible, tidy, and respectful of others' space. I have lived in several different cities throughout my life, and Utrecht for almost 2 years.

I currently live in a single apartment in Binnenstadt, but am looking for a two bedroom apartment to share with my friend Robin (29, Dutch, Full-time Senior Consultant).

I work fulltime with total financial compensation of 70,000. I am happy to provide proof of income, and reference from my current landlord if required.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Milo
