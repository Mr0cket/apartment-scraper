Hello,

I am a young professional from Australia working and living in Utrecht for the last 3 years. I'm 30 years old with a permanent contract as a Senior Software Engineer looking for a new place to call home in Utrecht.

I have annual salary with Devoteam of â‚¬65,000.

I will be renting this apartment by myself and I am looking to stay in Utrecht for the next 2 - 3 years.

I would like to discuss arranging an appointment for viewing your apartment on {STREET}.

I am happy to provide proof of my income, or any other documentation that is required.

Thank you and Kind Regards,
Milo Silva
